My husband Christopher, helped me order this item gift for a good friend who lost her daughter Kimberly. I\u2019ve ordered these 3D products before with wonderful results, but I\u2019m wondering now if maybe it was from a different company because I must tell you I was VERY disappointed with the end result of this one. It\u2019s very hard to see exactly what the finished product is going to look like on a computer screen, so thought choosing the heart design would work. But it didn\u2019t at all. The bottom of the heart looks like it\u2019s making a \u201cdent\u201d in the top of Kimberly\u2019s head. So there is no way I could possibility send this to my friend. I think your system should be able to advise you if the image submitted would not be a good fit and allow you to either choose a different item or perhaps suggest you selected a larger size heart. If given the choice, (for only $20 more) I could have chosen the large item \u201cbrick\u201d which would have looked much better. I was also surprised at how small the \u201cmedium\u201d heart was and the $60 jump in cost for the large size.   \n  So with all this being said, I\u2019d like to know what my options are and if it\u2019s possible to return this item for a full refund OR perhaps a reorder of something else.   \n  Thanks for your help.  \n  Pamela Peterson;  \n  \n\n Sent from my iPad  \nBegin forwarded message:","sentiment":0},{"text":"I ordered 5 key chains, I am not happy with.you can\u2019t see the pictures in them .I want to return them.","sentiment":0},{"text":"My husband absolutely loves it!
